Description: The purpose of this study is twofold: 1) test the effects of public health
  messages on smokeless tobacco use among pregnant and non-pregnant women and adolescent
  girls (age 14 and up); and 2) investigate factors associated with tobacco use among
  men, women, and children. This research took place among rural populations in
  Mysore, India. Research on substance use in India has traditionally focused on male
  populations, but there is a growing concern regarding the patterns of use among
  women (Murthy et al., 2010). In India, approximately 30% of women use some type of
  tobacco (Gupta and Ray 2003), and tobacco use among tribal women could be up to
  50%. Indian women who use smokeless tobacco have higher rates of stillbirths, lower
  birth weights, and reduced gestation periods (Rogers 2009).
